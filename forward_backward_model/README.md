# Model Based On
See this [blogpost.](http://deeplearningathome.com/2017/06/PyTorch-vs-Tensorflow-lstm-language-model.html)

## How to RUN:
Can you using jupyter notebook: jupyter_run.ipynb (can be used on google colab)
Can also run using script file: run_script.py

## Files
* lm.py - language model description
* reader.py - loads text data and converts between words and word_ids 
* create_vector.py - sets up models, creates vectors, and word embeddings. 
* run_script.py - runs the script
* jupyter_run.ipynb - runs the script

## Requirements
* Python 3 
* PyTorch
* Numpy
